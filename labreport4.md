Vim
Step 4

Keys pressed: I logged into ieng6 by searching through my command history with <control-R>, then typed s to search for and run ssh cs15lfa23ec@ieng6.ucsd.edu


Step 5

Keys pressed: I typed git clone git@github.com:taniaclemons/lab7.git with the copied fork of the repository from my Github account to clone it


Step 6

Keys pressed: I ran the bash test.sh command to run the tests commands that are stored in that file.


Step 7

Keys pressed: I typed vim ListExamples.java to edit the code file to fix the failing test. Went to the exact line for the error by typed 43G and e to hover over the 1 in index1 and pressed x to delete it. I entered insert mode with <i> and typed in 2 before going back to normal mode with <esc>. To save and quit I pressed <:> and entered wq.


Step 8

Keys pressed: <up> <up> <return> The bash test.sh command was 2 in history so I used the up arrow to access it and run it like in step 6.


Step 9

Keys pressed: Typed in git add ListExamples.java to include the changes of the edited file. Then typed git commit -m “LabReport4” to include the message with the changed file. Finally typed in git push to send the changes to my Github account.
